# A Brief on FinTech

<!-- ![fintech application](/images/posts/fintech-info.avif) -->

## Prologue
For both individuals and businesses, banking hasnâ€™t changed much from what it was for a few decades. Current accounts, saving accounts, credit cards, and mortgages are all, in essence, still the same.

A traditional bank typically has two types of customers: depositors and borrowers. The bank acts as an intermediary, using money entrusted to them by depositors to lend that money to borrowers at higher interest rates. 
Banks have two revenue streams, one being income from interest and the other the fees they charge. On top of this, they can earn additional revenue from cross-selling other products such as insurance.

Traditional banking has thrived for years because customers trust this system. The strength of these banks lies in their large datasets and customer bases, basically, the larger the network the more people are willing to invest or store their hard earn money. They can generate a large amount of capital from customer deposits at a low cost only because customers accept the low-interest rates on their savings accounts.

Traditional banks profit because of the large volume of funds that they manage, and the spread that they make on the interest rates between borrowing and lending. So far, it has been difficult for new entrants to compete with them because of their size and capital.

## The Term  FinTech
Fintech, the word, is a combination of "financial technology". The scope of fintech includes everything from mobile banking and insurance to cryptocurrency and investment, the term fintech has broad applications.

Financial technology (Fintech) is used to describe any new technology that seeks to find ways to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services. 

At its core, fintech is utilized to help companies, business owners, and consumers better manage their financial operations, processes, and lives by utilizing specialized software and algorithms that are used on computers and, increasingly, smartphones.

## FinTech in Practice
Online banking is at the heart of the operation of a fintech firm. Especially mobile banking accounts for about 29% of all transactions made in India for the year 2020. This trend is only going to increase in the future as more and more people are favouring digital payments over regular cash.

Apart from money transactions, few fintech firms are providing consumers access to invest their money in the equity market, the stock market. One such likely candidate is Zerodha, a company based in Bangalore, which is the largest retail stockbroker in India with an active client base. It contributes upwards of 15% of daily retail volumes across the Indian stock exchanges.

## What are Neobanks?

A neobank, also known as an online bank or a digital bank is a virtual bank that operates exclusively online without traditional physical branch networks. Neobank is a fintech firm that provides digital and mobile-first financial solutions like payments, money transfers, money lending, and more.

Consumers are moving away from physical banks and cash, furthermore moving towards online banking and digital wallets. We are witnessing people get more comfortable making online payments through smartphone applications like Paytm.

Since these neobanks don't have a physical location, no branch offices, they can charge lesser account opening and maintenance charges, while also offering a higher savings interest rate than their counterparts. Thereby making them a major threat to commercial banking firms.

## Conclusion
Some fintech start-ups are competing directly with the commercial boys, whilst some have partnered with them, some even supply them with services. One thing is for certain that fintech companies are improving the financial services world by introducing innovative ideas and increasing competition in the Indian market.
