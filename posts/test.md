# Hello, World

This is a subject line. Please make sure not to include any html tags.

My `name big man` is **Vikram Singh Negi**, a ==self-taught== `developer` who likes to hack his [laptop](https://mi.com/mi-notebook-14). The way you **move** is so [good](#how-to-use). This is because [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) has states, we used it to store previous move data, record history.

> I hope you are doing alright. I really do care about to a lot.

```python
def makeCode(line):
  foundCode = re.findall(r"\`(\w+?)\`", line)
  for text in foundCode:
    line = re.sub(r"\`(\w+?)\`", f"<code>{text}</code>", line, count=1)

  if foundCode:
    return line
```

Holly shit!

## Weather & Air Quality

This project is hosted on Heroku, here is the [link](https://weather-and-air-quality.herokuapp.com/) and also check out my [twitter](https://twitter.com/lostvikx).

This project took quite a while to *build*, along the way I discovered various caching **strategies** which are [implemented](#) on front-end, web-browsers, and back-end, *proxy* servers.

This project was made possible by multiple diffrent JavaScript libraries and public APIs.

* Leaflet.js
* Express.js
* [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
* [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/)

The ***website is a simple way to get*** weather and air quality data from a number of different locations around the globe.
