      <h1>The Entire History of Me</h1>

      <p>
        I was always passionate about computers since the tender age of ten. It all started when my parents bought me a brand new desktop computer.
      </p>

      <p>
        I didn&apos;t know what the internet was back then, so I used to mess around on my computer by creating doodles on MS Paint and playing those retro in-build Windows XP games.

      <h2>Coding Journey</h2>

      <p>
        Learning to code on your own comes with its own sets of challenges. Such as not knowing how to start learning or what to learn in the first place. It&apos;s the persistent effort and determination that allowed me to look at the other side of the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started programming because I wanted my dream, to create my own company someday, to come true. While pursuing my vision, I found a new hobby. I quickly developed a passion for programming, which has evolved into something I love doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first-ever programming language that I learned was JavaScript. Even though it is not a perfect language, it has a few core design errors, but nothing in life is perfect.
